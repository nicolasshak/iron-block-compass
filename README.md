# Iron Block Compass

A Minecraft mod that allows players to alter the point where compasses lead. Just right click on a block of iron with a compass in your hand to set the compass' destination.

**Note:** Unlike lodestones, the compass will not be reset if the block of iron used to set it is broken!
